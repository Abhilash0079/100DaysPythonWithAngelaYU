# number = int(input()) # Which number do you want to check?

# if number % 2 = 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")


#####Solution
#Error line 3 if number % 2 = 0
#Remember the single = is an assignment.
#Double == checks the equality.


number = int(input()) # Which number do you want to check?

if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
